                        <p class=" mx-5 ">Bill Bryson in his book ‘A Short History of Nearly Everything’ has described Physics as really nothing more than a look for ultimate simplicity. Physics is a study of matter, the fundamental object that makes just about anything and the energy that binds the matter. It is an experimental science that uses the logical method to formulate and test a set of hypothesis.</p>
