                        <p class=" mx-5 ">Roger Bacon (1214-1294)  has described Mathematics as the door and the key to the sciences. A neglect of mathematics hurts all the knowledge, because one is ignorant of it cannot know the other sciences or the things of the world. Mathematics or maths as it is popularly called is a game of numbers.  These numbers work under a set of rules that set the rule for the “number game i.e mathematics”. Maths is by far the easiest subject in the curriculum.  The student needs to know the rules of the number game and he is a winner if he plays it well.
